# GIF Creation from Images Using MoviePy and Google Colab

This script demonstrates how to create a GIF from an image or a sequence of images using the `moviepy` library in a Google Colab environment. It allows users to upload multiple image files, convert them into a GIF, and then download the resulting GIF file.

## Requirements

- Python
- Google Colab
- `moviepy` library
- `google.colab` library

## Usage

1. **Upload Images**:
   - Run the script in a Google Colab notebook.
   - You will be prompted to upload image files. Select and upload at least one image file.

2. **Create GIF**:
   - The script will automatically create a GIF from the uploaded images using the `moviepy` library.
   - The GIF will be generated with a frame rate of 10 frames per second.You can also adjust the frame rate.

3. **Download GIF**:
   - Once the GIF is created, it will be available for download.
   - Click on the provided download link to save the GIF to your local system.

## Explanation

1. **Upload Images**:
   - `files.upload()` is used to upload images from your local system. The uploaded files are stored in a dictionary for processing.

2. **Check Uploaded Files**:
   - The script verifies that at least one file has been uploaded. If no files are uploaded, it will raise an error.

3. **Create GIF**:
   - The `ImageSequenceClip` function from `moviepy` creates a video clip from the sequence of images. The GIF is generated with a frame rate of 10 frames per second and saved to a specified path.

4. **Download GIF**:
   - The script provides a download link for the created GIF file, allowing you to save it to your local system.

## Notes

- Ensure that you run this script in a Google Colab environment for the `files.upload()` and `files.download()` functions to work properly.
- The GIF file will be named `gif.gif` and saved in the current working directory. You can also change the name of the GIF File.
- You can adjust the frame rate by modifying the `fps` parameter if needed.
